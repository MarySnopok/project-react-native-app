# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

My personal favorite movie artefact The Magic Ball with a supernatural power of predicting the future for one unlucky guy from "Interstate 60" , with the super cool Gary Oldman in the cast. If you did not try me app yet , feel free to follow the link or/and check the code , but if you haven't watched the "Interstate 60"... just do it )) I know u will like it).
